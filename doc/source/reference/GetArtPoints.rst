GetArtPoints
''''''''''''

.. function:: GetArtPoints(InGraph,ArtNIdV)

Returns articulation points of an undirected *InGraph*.

Parameters:

- *InGraph*: undirected graph (input)
    A Snap.py undirected graph.

- *ArtNIdV*: :class:`TInt64V`, a vector of ints (output)
    The node ids of the articulation points in the grpah *InGraph*.

Return value:

- None

The following example shows how to find articulation points in a graph of type
:class:`TNGraph`::

    import snap 
    
    UGraph = snap.GenRndGnm(snap.PUNGraph, 1000, 10) 
    ArtNIdV = snap.TInt64V() 
    snap.GetArtPoints(UGraph, ArtNIdV) 
    
    print "Articulation points of a random Undirected Graph : " 
    for NI in ArtNIdV:
        print "node: %d" % NI
